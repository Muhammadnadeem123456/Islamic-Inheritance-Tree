Submission of Python Code for Property Distribution Rules

Dear [CEO's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to submit the Python code I developed for automating the property distribution rules based on Islamic inheritance laws. This code is designed to handle various scenarios including the distribution among the wife, daughters, granddaughters, father, mother, sisters etc.

Attached to this email, you will find the following documents:

Python Code File: This contains the implemented code that calculates the inheritance shares based on different input scenarios.
Test Cases File: This file includes various test cases used to verify the correctness of the code, ensuring it meets the specified requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.
Please review the attached files at your convenience. I am available for any questions or further clarifications you may require.


.

Best regards,
